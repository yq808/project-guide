## Python

| Project Link | Project Description | Areas | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| [*Twitch Game Popularity Predictor*](https://github.com/yq808/twitch-steam-game-predictor) | A machine learning model written in Python to predict game popularity on Twitch via Steam and Twitch data. Used web scraping and APIs to collect game attributes, and conducted exploratory data analysis to understand industry trends. Built a gradient boosted classifier and regressor, achieving strong predictive performance. Applied Bayesian Optimization and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning | Web scraping, API querying, data cleaning, machine learning, data visualization, hyperparameter tuning | Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, requests, Matplotlib, scikit-learn | 
| [*Global Trade Analysis*](https://github.com/yq808/us-china-trade-analysis) | An economic data analysis project exploring the economic relations between US-China as indicated by trade values, exchange rates, and news coverage. Used web scraping and APIs to collect data from the UN Comtrade database, CurrencyBeacon API, and news sites. Conducted linear regression analysis to identify significant relationships between trade values, exchange rates, and news coverage, and compared them against an independently collected sample to validate consistency in the observed trends. | Web scraping, API querying, data cleaning, regression analysis | Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, requests, Matplotlib, statsmodels, SciPy |   
| [*r/ADHD Network Structures and Sentiments Analysis*](https://github.com/yq808/reddit-network-sentiment-analysis) | The aim of the project was to identify conversation trends, key users, and community perceptions in online support communities. We queried the Reddit API to gather posts, comments, and user information data from the r/ADHD subreddit. The network analysis included metrics such as the number of nodes and edges, network density, and degree distribution. Also used natural language processing techniques to conduct sentiment analysis to identify key words and key conversation topics, resulting in actionable recommendations for improvements in medication. | API querying, network analysis, NLP, data visualization | TextBlob, Pandas, Statsmodels, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, PRAW, NetworkX, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, spaCy |

## SQL
| Project Link | Project Description | Area | 
|---|---|---|
| [*Los Angeles Travel Database Application*](https://github.com/yq808/LA-travel-database-site) | Developed a dynamic travel website driven by user interactions, with content retrieved from a ClearDB RDBMS using SQL. The website has create, read, update, and delete functionality at different user permission levels to control content access, allowing users to login and manage their own list of Los Angeles attractions. Performed usability testing with HotJar to optimize the website's design and performance, resulting in 13\% lower bounce rates and smoother navigation | MySQL, RDBMS |
